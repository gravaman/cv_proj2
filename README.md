# CS 6476 project 2: [Local Feature Matching](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/compvision/proj2/)


# Setup
- Install <a href="https://conda.io/miniconda.html">Miniconda</a>. It doesn't matter whether you use 2.7 or 3.6 because we will create our own environment anyways.
- Create a conda environment, using the appropriate command. On Windows, open the installed "Conda prompt" to run this command. On MacOS and Linux, you can just use a terminal window to run the command. Modify the command based on your OS ('linux', 'mac', or 'win'): `conda env create -f environment_<OS>.yml`
- This should create an environment named `cs6476`. Activate it using the following Windows command: `activate cs6476` or the following MacOS / Linux command: `source activate cs6476`.
- Run the notebook using: `jupyter notebook ./code/proj2.ipynb`
- Generate the submission once you're finished using `python zip_submission.py`
